# Niyantri Dog Care Website

This project generates a multi-page static website for a premium dog grooming business named "Niyantri Dog Care". It includes a responsive Tailwind CSS design, a full-width hero, a social proof bar, and a simple client-side shopping cart with PayPal checkout integration placeholder.

What youâ€™ll get:
- index.html: Home page with hero, social proof, and testimonials.
- services.html: Service packages with Add to Cart buttons.
- about.html: Company history and values.
- contact.html: Contact info and a basic form.
- cart.html: Dynamic cart with items, total, and checkout button.
- checkout.html: PayPal checkout integration (replace YOUR_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID).
- Common header and footer across all pages (identical structure).
- README.md with setup and notes.

Notes:
- Location placeholder used: Hyderabad, India.
- All images use placeholder srcs as described: src='https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1753596726281-8fd876febab8?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHwuLi58ZW58MHwwfHx8MTc1NjgxMzYyNHww&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080'.
- The site uses a warm orange accent color (#F97316).
- All styling is done with Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- Page load has a gentle fade-in animation. Sections below the hero fade in on scroll.
- The PayPal integration is a placeholder. Replace YOUR_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID with your actual client id in checkout.html.
